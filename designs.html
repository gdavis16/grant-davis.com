        This page highlights some of my creations and my thought processes during the creation’s construction and development as a model. The fun in building LEGO for me is in the practice of building, so I hope to give you an insight to the joy I have in creating.

    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Having grown up playing Pokémon games, I really enjoyed the playfulness that the series provided and thought it would be a perfect fit to recreate something from it out of LEGO. A couple of years prior to building this in 2018 I stumbled upon this drawing by deviant-art user Nerd-Scribbles, and felt inspired to embrace the concept and try my hand at recreating it in LEGO.
    </div>
    <div class="image">

    <div class="text">
      Seeing as the Pokéball was almost completely circular, I had an uphill battle in trying to achieve a truthful recreation. The first solution that I thought of involved the use of flex pipe (6mm rigid hose) around the perimeter of the Pokéball and a large amount of clips with tiles attached to mimic a circular shape, but quickly found the gaps left in between the pieces were anything but aesthetically pleasing. <br>
      <br>
      <br>Eventually I stumbled upon the idea of using the 1x2 hinges, stabilized by flex pipe on the backside. At the time however, I didn’t have nearly enough of the hinges in white or red to complete a circle, so I built my prototype out of light blueish grey hinges (color ID 42069), and put in an order for the exact amount I needed, replacing the gray, resulting in the photo bellow.

      Producing the walls on the inside of the build proved to be the most difficult challenge of all. Turns out creating smooth, concave surfaces out of square bricks is tricky! The best answer came to me in the form of an illegal technique. By using the inner surface of a stack of partly separated jumper plates, I was able to create rings of all different sizes. To stabilize each part of a ring, I made sure and provide an attachment for on each end of the section. Once this idea was established, it was a simple matter of taking a trip to my local LEGO store and picking up a few thousand dark tan jumper plates from the Pick-a-Brick wall and assembling the inside of the Pokéball.

      The final details came together easily, I especially enjoyed making Pikachu’s chair and TV. Up until this point the inside of the build felt kind of bland, but I was able to add just the right amount of color on the floor and the shelf to make the build pop, and feel like it is really lived in.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      One additional thing to mention about this creation and it’s stability was that I was able to take with me on a flight from my home in Portland to Brickworld Chicago, without any damage whatsoever to the integrity of the walls.

    <div class="text">
      This is a completely original creation that integrates several new stonework and foliage ideas that help create a really clean smooth look. The model started with the idea of using the ends 4L bars in light blueish grey to mimic little pebbles in a stone wall. Coupled with 1x1 and 2x2 tiles, I was able to create a really detailed, yet flat textured wall and pathway. To mount the stones securely, I built a lattice of bars along the back of the creation to attach all different kinds of clips and arms. Additionally, using the same attachment method, I was able to integrate a vine made from green droid arms into the stonework. The colors in the wall were all topped off with the inclusion of a stray medium azure flower here and there.

    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Once I completed the stonework, I had the difficult task of carefully integrating the rounded stones in the grass around the shrine. Lots of forethought went into planning the locations of the stones so that they would line up on the stud grid when I needed to make the transition to foliage.

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      The creation was topped off by placing a tree atop of the shrine, as a symmetric symbol growth and sturdiness. The leaf pieces that I used at the time had just been released in 2018, so I was amongst the first to create a tree out of them. In order to make the leaves seem even smoother than they are, I followed the theme of the build and used the bar end of bright green carrot stems to fill in the holes in the leave’s studs, eliminating some of the dark spots on the tree making it feel very smooth and happy.

    <div class="text">
      The painted city is a collaborative project between fellow builders Micah Beideman, Eli Willsea and myself, it was built in the summer of 2019 and posted in the beginning of 2020. Because we wanted to be on the same page about what we were building, we elected to attempt to recreate a piece of concept art originally painted by LZY

      The general division of labor was that Eli built the right side, Micah built the left side, and I built the backdrop, however, as the creation was constructed and stored at my house, I had a big hand in ensuring that all part of the creation flowed together effectively. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The backdrop of this creation depicts a what a post-apocalyptic city would look like if it was given a fresh coat of paint. Careful attention had to be paid to the use of different colors in this creation, to make it pop while still feeling run down. Using earthly and muted colors, I was able to bring a highlight to the interesting red roofs used throughout the city. I thoroughly enjoyed making each and every structure seen in the backdrop, as unique as possible, often employing a cheese slope mosaic or stickered piece to add an extra bit of texture.

      The buildings in the foreground were completely different to create than the largely light blueish grey background, but are extremely interesting in their own right. Because of the large amount of colors used, again extra care had to be taken to ensure that the building flowed and seemed realistic. Although we were working from an image as inspiration, large amount of creative decisions had to be made when transferring the build into the medium of LEGO bricks.

      The final result is the culmination of several weeks work amounting to my most ambitious creation to date. Each section alone stands by itself, but together combine together to make a scene that does the original art justice.

      Built for the Colossal Castle Contest in 2014, this creation was the highlight of my early building career displaying of the most advanced rockwork for its time. This scene was briefly shown in the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring in a sweeping pan shot, giving me little more than a few frames to reference when creating the model. Being a huge Lord of the Rings fan however, I was more than willing to meticulously save and print out screenshots of the film to use as reference.

      The colors used in this creation were kept to a minimal to highlight the action of the battle happening between the orcs and urikai. This creation also serves as a great example of my use of minifigs to create stories within a model, that would otherwise be absent.
